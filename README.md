# Board-Game-Review-Predictions-Using-ML

I retrieved Board Games data form Sean Beck (ThaWeatherman) Github Repository which is available with MIT License, Note that there are 80000+ games data in the games.csv file. Generally, about 80% of the time spent in data analysis is cleaning and retrieving data, but this workload can be reduced by finding high-quality data sources. The games.csv file have lots of board game data which can be parsed in languages such as Python or R.

The complete data file is available for <a href="https://github.com/ThaWeatherman/scrapers/blob/master/boardgamegeek/games.csv">download</a> for those wanting to follow along.
This data is used to pridict average rating by using Machine learning algorithms Linear Regressor(LR) and Random Forest Regressor and compare pridicted average rating by LR, RFR and actual value, we find that RFR is providing much more correct predictions
